    <h2 class="bold">Nothing silly here.</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="para">
		Here’s something silly. Probably silly to you and only you, and by “you”, I mean the world out there. Well, it’s not my fault that all that isn’t me is a You to me. (Wink wink)
	  </p>
        <p class="para">
		Let’s start from the very beginning:
        <p>Lemon Rice.</p>
	  </p>
        <p class="para">
		Ever since I was a teeny tiny little kid, I wanted my mother to make me lemon rice. She always asked, “Why do you want lemon rice? It’s like the easiest thing to make.” I didn’t understand this logic. ‘If it’s the easiest thing to make, isn’t that wonderful news for you?’ This was lost on her, and me.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
		Rarely Mother said, “Alright I’ll make it for you.” I think it was just the one time, but who’s counting. (Oh, that’s right, me.) I think she’d set out to do exactly that, at least that morning. But as usual, she made a really complex version of it, and it wasn’t lemon rice that I ate that afternoon either.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
		Not to say it didn’t taste great. Honestly, I really like her complex cooking now. But back then, and throughout, well… When you want something and you don’t get it, I suppose it just builds up in your head. You start imagining, fantasizing. Lemon rice becomes a wedding cake becomes macaroons become lobster becomes… everything you could possibly imagine. And you wonder, why? Why not?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
		Well probably cause she’s a working lady and likes to make these things that can be stored and not opt for a food option you need to consume at once. (But yeah, didn’t get it then.)
        </p>
        <p class="para">
		So why all this backstory? Because my child, I grew it so humongous in my head, that I figured if I can make lemon rice, then I am my own person.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
		I figured then, I would have achieved what I wanted to in life. And be able to create my own life, do whatever I wanted with it. Because Then I would be Able.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
		And 2 days ago, I did it. For the first time in my life at the age of 22, I tried my hand at lemon rice. And let me tell You: IT was the best-damned lemon rice I’ve ever had.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
		So yeah. I did it!!
        </p>
	  <h2 class="para">P.S?</h2>
        <p class="para">
		Why did I never try it before You ask? Who can say? Well, I can. It’s because Lemon rice becomes a wedding cake becomes macaroons become lobster becomes… Everything.
