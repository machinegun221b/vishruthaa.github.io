          The world is filled with people, we’re at 8 billion now. Although research into current birth and death rates shows that the human population will peak in this century, in the event that we become a space-faring civilization, the population is bound to and needs to rise, way, way higher, i.e., we’re gonna need a lot more humans.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          We are all the same. Human. We have the same underlying mechanisms that give us life, the same bodily functions and organs. We have the same basal range of emotions and we are all equipped to function, albeit in our own ways. And yet, we have so many languages to communicate the same fundamental information amongst ourselves. A few different modes of speech. We have a culture that is unique to our communities, and methods of expression that may differ slightly from one person to another, or community. But we’re all one people. Of the same planet. We breathe the same air and drink the same water. (I do wonder, however, do people think the air feels different from place to place, you know how they say that the water tastes different - depending on what minerals of what concentration the water contains? I mean apart from the altitude and pollution I mean.)
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          When we’re all on the same planet and hence relatively similar environments and climates, and yet we have such huge differences, what is to happen if we lived on multiple planets? Will we wage wars again? Start colonising and whatnot shit. I mean the weapons are bound to be much more horrifying than what we have today, right? And what of those people who want total world domination? They won’t just go extinct. What then?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          Is the only way out of a dystopian future by ensuring we achieve equality and no disparity such as so-called “developing”, “developed” and “under-developed” countries? Is anyone working toward that end? I mean the people with the resources, they’d have no real problem with a dystopian future I’d have to assume. So who’s gonna be working, to make sure our future isn’t dystopic? And what are they doing to make it so?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          From what I’ve read or known, globalization is not the solution. Copying the western world and applying their lessons to our worlds and living situations, those things do NOT work. Because the problems are different. When the problem statements themselves are so different, how does it make sense to employ a solution from an entirely different questionnaire?
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          So how do we eliminate this disparity? Where do we go from here? And how long before we have a world with equal opportunities and access to proper education and healthcare, everywhere?

          This will be a topic with a separate series within the 100 days challenge. What we’ll try to do is think deeply about the future.<br>
          Will we discuss communism, I don’t know. All I know is, we will discuss the future.
