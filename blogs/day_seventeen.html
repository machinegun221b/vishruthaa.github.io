        <p class="para">
          The reason I started to write a piece a day for a hundred days is to be able to better process my thoughts and put them out there more. To try and put as much of myself out there as possible and in that process give my writing a boost. Writing is the best way to make your way through your thoughts, or so I believe. 
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          I thought I’d do a weekly thing, where I’d focus on a particular topic each week and shift focus again over the weekend to another. But I’ve come to realize that would make the work suffer, especially right now. The longer I take to write one after the other, the more research I can do and there’s a limitless source of information called the internet now, so essentially, the research can never be finished. 
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          So for the time being we are not going to be doing that. While writing about a particular topic every day, as it seems, is out of the question for me I’d like to keep writing every single day and hence, the interspersion.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          What do I mean by that? I’ll instead intersperse one with the other, i.e., the 100-day series will be interspersed with what we saw during the first two weeks along with what I’ve been trying to do this past week.  To make it easier for you to manoeuvre your way through these, I’ll create a filter function or something like that on the website and highlight the other series - yet to come up with a name for that - separately on Instagram as well.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          <br>
          You can find all the pieces on the Speak Your Mind website and if you’re interested there’s also a division called the PseudoPoetsSociety - of which you can be a part and contribute if you’re interested.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          And other than all of this, you can also contribute by giving me ideas or questions that you’d like for me to write about as well.
          So let me know if there’s anything on your mind and let’s experiment with everything.
        </p>
