      <div class="content">
        <p class="para">
          Doing the right thing doesn’t mean being nice. It doesn’t even always mean being a decent human being. Sometimes they’re counterintuitive. A lot of times, they’re very difficult, emotionally. Like pulling the plug on a family member or euthanizing. Or leaving your crying infant alone so they can learn to self-soothe or having to have a leash on your dog, ultimately,  for their own good.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          Right or wrong, whatever you do, ultimately matters only to you. People may judge, for a day, an hour or once in a while whenever the topic comes up. That’s at the most, at least I believe, that people have time to spend thinking of other people’s business. On the other hand, you have to live with yourself every moment of every day for the rest of your life. 
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          More than that, right or wrong, is another thing that’s just personal. It’s about perception and each one of us has our own point of view. Our thought processes aren’t exactly synced with one another. 
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          Whether you think something is right or isn’t, it’s not just about being rational. The emotions tied to certain decisions and events in our lives are what make the most difficult of choices to be made. 
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          As long as you’re not hurting anyone, including and especially yourself, whatever decision you make, you can most probably live with it. And before you think of taking care of everyone around you, in a world where people are mostly obsessed with their own problems, you should probably be focusing on yours, and taking care of what you need the most. 
        </p>
        
       
        <p class="para">
          Day 9. <br>
          Will probably be back with another iteration of this.
