          So it’s been a week since I started writing an article a day. They haven’t all had the right structure or followed the rules of writing so far. But even still, I do have some that I really liked from the past week. I will be picking a maximum of three articles per week that I liked and highlighting them on my Instagram stories. 
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          In the past week, I think the most difficult thing has been deciding what to write about each day. Whoever said that decision-making is what takes it out of you the most, was right. Steve Jobs, all of them, they were right. 
        </p>
        <p class="para">
	  Going forward, I want to set a theme for the articles I write every week. Depending on the topic, there will either be one topic for the whole week or two topics per week. This is literally a spur-of-the-moment decision I’m making as I’m writing this at this very moment because it’s not easy to come up with a good topic and actually stick to what you wrote every day. I come up with an average of three topics every time I sit down to write, and halfway through or sometimes even after almost finishing it, I just don’t feel like posting it, and scrub the whole thing and start over. So now this experiment shall commence, either three days from now, or next week - Monday. 
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          I have been all over the place with my writing and with the topics, everything. So I do hope sticking to a specific topic will also help with that. But I still will be writing a few pieces, here and there, that will just be whipped up and something similar to the past week. 
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          Let me know what you think. If you’d like me to stick with the spontaneous stuff, or if you will grow to like something with a bit more substance and structure. Your opinions really would matter as I figure out what would be worthwhile, or understanding what is seemingly something people really do like to think about and spend time on. Actually! You could even give me topics, tell me what you’d like for me to write.

          And that’s all we have today, for Day 8.<br>
          See ya tomorrow!
