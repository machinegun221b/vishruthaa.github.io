		The wonder of not knowing doesn't come from knowing<br> 
		It's birthed in the unknown<br> 
		It rises in what you have no way of knowing<br> 
		And when you finally see it<br>
		When you finally learn of it<br>
		When you finally learn of how much you don't<br> 
		That's when you really  grow<br>
	  </p>

        <p class="para">
		You rise from the ashes of the success you had in your little bubble<br>
		You rise from the ashes of your imaginary world crumpled to pieces simply because of your ignorance<br> 
		The laziness<br>
		The lack of reality<br> 
		Because of your caged upbringing<br> 
		Because someone said YOU couldn't<br> 
		That you can't<br>
	  </p>

        <p class="para">
		And every time you break the ceiling, you break your bubble<br>
	  </p>

        <p class="para">
		You shatter the very ground they stood on<br> 
		But there was never hatred<br> 
		There was never even love<br> 
		What was it<br> 
		Was it oneness<br>  
		No<br> 
		Was it ignorance<br> 
		No<br> 
		Was it that they thought they owned not just you, but your entire life<br> 
		Or is that what you think of them<br> 
		What you think they do<br> 
		Will you ever know<br> 
		Will they ever know themselves<br>  
		They do<br> 
		It's the acceptance that's difficult<br> 
	  </p>

        <p class="para">
		What you realise now<br>
		The real struggle begins once you shatter it<br>
		Once it's all broken and you begin as ashes again<br>
	  </p>
        
        <p class="para">
		Because once it's shattered<br>
		The earth under no longer holds<br>
		Neither you<br>
		Nor them<br>
