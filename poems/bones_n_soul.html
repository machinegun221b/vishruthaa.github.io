		As I stared into her eyes<br>
		Glaring at my face<br> 
		Teeth scuttling into each other<br> 
		Disgusted she looked into my soul<br>
		While I looked back into hers, terrified<br>
		Absolutely unabashed<br> 
		She bore her nails into my skin<br>
		And I laid there<br>
		Tethering my soul to my backbone<br>
		It weeped and cried<br>
		Jumped up and all around<br>
		Like a mad man in chains on an asylum floor<br>
		But my skin, stone cold<br>
		Froze my muscles to their bones<br>
	  </p>

        <p class="para">
		And I laid there<br>
		Putting an exterior<br>
		Calm and composed<br> 
		Held the tears back<br>
		Pushed them into their ducts<br>
		As I laid there<br>
		Waiting for it to be over<br>
	  </p>

        <p class="para">
		Her nails dug into my skin<br>
		Her teeth clasped into my flesh<br>
		Her spit on my tongue<br>
		And my bones were all that were me<br>
		Silent and afloat<br>
		In this dimension<br> 
		While I was away in another<br>
		Known to none but me<br>
		I was no longer waiting for it to be over<br>
		As far as I knew<br>
		There was nothing to be over<br>
	  </p>

        <p class="para">
		A slight jolt in my nerves<br> 
		And my soul was no longer tethered<br> 
		My stoney bones were no longer cold<br> 
		My skin and flesh were no longer whole<br> 
		They were ripped and I was broken<br> 
		As she sublimed<br> 
		I solidified<br>  
		Whole again but torn in places to never be put together again<br> 
		Burnt so you could never even find the pieces<br> 
	  </p>
        <p class="para">
		Ears flaming red and hot<br>
		Soul sprung back to life<br>
		Nowhere to let go<br>
		No-one to turn to<br>
		Nothing to feel<br>
		She cried<br>
		In vain<br>
		Soundless and alone<br>
		In pain<br>
		Always to count on<br>
