        <p class="para">
		I feel torn<br>
		And sewn back together<br> 
		But the pieces<br> 
		They weren't put back right<br>
		They left holes<br>
		They left gaps<br>
		And in the hollowed proof of my existence<br> 
		My soul was no longer mine<br>
	  </p>

        <p class="para">
		Pain<br>
		They tell me<br>
		To let it go<br>
		Move on<br>
		Do you expect to see me walking around<br> 
		With my chest carved out<br>
		Abdomen disfigured<br> 
		Cause you know just as well...<br>
		My pain<br>
		It's a part of me<br>
		Like the ocean carving out a cliff, a boulder<br>
		My pain chiseled me<br> 
		Into what stands before you<br> 
		Although it does, barely<br>
		Stand before you, it does<br> 
	  </p>
        <p class="para">
		With every ounce of strength my pain gave me<br> 
		Through the years<br>
		I've borne it<br>
		Because pain<br>
		Unlike the human soul, is self serving<br> 
		The soul<br>
		It's a treacherous being<br>
		It cheats you and then it berates you<br> 
		For all its mistakes<br>
		You pay the price<br> 
		As you begin to lose it<br> 
		You feel human a little less and a little less<br>
		But that is the only thing that reminds you of your humanness<br> 
	  </p>
        <p class="para">
		But before you become consumed by so called enlightened thoughts<br>
		Take inventory<br>
		And savor every moment of the silence that it brings you<br>
		Before you label it as numbness<br> 
		Consider this<br> 
		The journey of losing your soul<br>
		Might just be the most blessed thing your cursed existence ever embarked on<br> 
	  </p>
        <p class="para">
		Now you want to be human again<br> 
		I have to admit<br> 
		The naiveness of that treacherous being<br> 
		Is somewhat cute<br> 
		I suppose you never fully lost it after all<br> 
		Despite my efforts<br> 
		You held onto it<br>
		Dreams you called them<br>
		How naive I whisper again<br> 
		And again<br> 
		Only for you to reject me<br> 
		Over and over again<br> 
		When will you learn to embrace me<br>
		I ask myself, really<br> 
		Because I am pain<br>
		I give you as much as you think I take<br>
	  </p>
        <p class="para">
		And before she could clasp her hands tight to stop the typing<br>
		She knew<br>
		There was no point in hiding from it<br>
		For it was the truth<br>
		The pain<br>
		She realized<br> 
		Was more a part of her than she'd let herself believe<br> 
		For I was her<br>
		And she was it<br>
		And it became you<br>
		As all the pronouns got lost in the mess that was our mind<br>
